/*
The color tag changes the color of the text depending on what color you set it as.

The Font-Family tag changes the font of the texts of the web page depending on what you set it as. For example: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif. 

The Font-size tag changes the size of the font.

The text-align tag changes where the alignment of the text will be. It can be left, right, or middle. 

The lines that have a "." in the beginning, those are Classes. Classes can be seen just like the .greenlist line. Every line in the main HTML that uses a class or div in their section, they can use "class=".greenlist"" to apply the mentioned styles/design within the .greenlist class.
